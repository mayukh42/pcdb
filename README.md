PC Hardware Inventory Manager

## An app to manage pc inventory

Over years, one may accumulate several pc builds, 
and not dispose of old ones, leading to a huge 
inventory of pc hardware that have their uses as 
swap parts, or may be rebuilt into sleeper pcs for
specific tasks.

This huge list of inventory can be initially 
managed with spreadsheets but it is better to 
have an app that 

1. Adds new inventory
2. Has a build functionality
3. Tracks usage of each build
4. Estimates RoI of Item or at Build level
       across several builds it has been part of
5. RoI Reports
